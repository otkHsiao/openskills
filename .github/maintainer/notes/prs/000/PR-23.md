## Intent
Clarify that installs are project-local by default so non‑Claude users don’t assume global install behavior.

## Relationship Quality
No linked issues; doc clarification only.

## Agent Score Adjustment
Low priority; the README was recently rewritten and may already address this.

## Implementation Plan
Review current README and add a short line if the “project install by default” point is still unclear.

## Resolution
Closed after v1.4.0 clarified project-local default installs in README and installer messaging.

## Draft Response (requires approval)
Thanks for the PR! I recently refreshed the README, so I’ll check if this clarification is still needed and incorporate it if not already covered.
