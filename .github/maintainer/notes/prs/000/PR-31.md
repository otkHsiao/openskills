## Intent
Add a `--symlink` flag to install local skills by creating symlinks instead of copying, enabling live updates from a dev repo.

## Relationship Quality
No linked issues. Relationship quality remains none.

## Agent Score Adjustment
This is a quality-of-life improvement for local development. Medium confidence, pending a decision on supporting symlink installs in core.

## Implementation Plan
1. Add `--symlink` option to `install` command and `InstallOptions`.
2. In local installs, create symlink instead of `cpSync` when flag is set.
3. Add tests for symlink behavior (happy path + broken link handling).
4. Update README with short example.

## Draft Response (requires approval)
Thanks for the PR! The symlink workflow is helpful. I’m deciding whether we want to support this via a flag (vs the current manual symlink guidance). I’ll follow up once that decision is made.
