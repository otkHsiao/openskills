## Intent
Fix Windows path security check by using `path.sep` instead of hardcoded `/`. The PR correctly identifies the root cause and provides a clean, minimal fix.

**What it does**:
1. Imports `sep` from `path` module
2. Replaces 3 occurrences of `'/'` with `sep` in security checks
3. Updates tests to use `sep` and `resolve()` for cross-platform compatibility
4. Adds Windows-specific test cases

## Relationship Quality
**Strong** - This PR directly solves all linked issues (#28, #34, #29, #17, #20). The approach is correct and maintains security guarantees on all platforms.

## Agent Score Adjustment
**Score: 95** (high confidence)

Rationale:
- Best quality of all Windows fix PRs
- Clean, focused changes (+35/-12 lines)
- Well-documented with clear root cause analysis
- Includes proper test coverage
- Uses the correct Node.js approach (`path.sep`)

## Implementation Plan
1. Apply the `path.sep` changes from this PR to `src/commands/install.ts`
2. Update `tests/commands/install.test.ts` with the test improvements
3. Also include version fix from PR #37 (read from package.json)
4. Run tests to verify
5. Close this PR and related PRs with thanks

## Draft Response (requires approval)
```
Thank you @didierhk for this excellent PR! Your root cause analysis was spot-on, and the `path.sep` solution is exactly the right approach.

I've implemented the fix based on your approach:
- Using `path.sep` for cross-platform path validation in all 3 security check locations
- Updating tests to use `sep` and `resolve()` for proper cross-platform testing
- Adding the Windows-specific test cases you outlined

This fix will unblock all Windows users. Really appreciate your contribution to making openskills work across all platforms!

Closing this PR as the fix has been merged.
