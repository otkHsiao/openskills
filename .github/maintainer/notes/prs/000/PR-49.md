## Intent
Add a line to AGENTS.md usage instructions telling users to install OpenSkills if it’s missing. This is a documentation nudge to help new developers in repos where AGENTS.md already exists.

## Relationship Quality
No linked issues; doc-only improvement. Relationship quality remains none.

## Agent Score Adjustment
Low-impact doc change. Could be accepted with slight wording to avoid implying global install is required for all environments.

## Implementation Plan
1. Update `src/utils/agents-md.ts` usage block with a neutral note: “If openskills isn’t available, install it (e.g., `npm i -g openskills` or `npx openskills`).”
2. Regenerate AGENTS.md via `openskills sync` if needed.
3. No tests required.

## Resolution
Closed after v1.5.0. README now clarifies `npx` usage and that install is optional; AGENTS.md not updated.

## Draft Response (requires approval)
Thanks for the PR! We standardized on `npx` examples and want install to remain optional (no requirement for global install). I added a small README tip for human usage and closed this out in v1.5.0.
