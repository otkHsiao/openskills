## Intent
Bump the CLI version string to 1.3.0.

## Relationship Quality
No linked issues; superseded by the dynamic version fix in v1.3.1.

## Agent Score Adjustment
No longer relevant; version is read from package.json now.

## Implementation Plan
None needed; already solved by dynamic versioning.

## Draft Response (requires approval)
Thanks for the PR! We’ve switched to reading the version directly from package.json (v1.3.1), so this manual bump is no longer needed. Closing with appreciation for the help.
