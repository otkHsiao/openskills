## Intent
Replace string-based path checks with `path.relative()` for cross-platform safety and add extensive test coverage.

## Relationship Quality
Not explicitly linked, but effectively addresses the Windows path-validation bug cluster already resolved in v1.3.1.

## Agent Score Adjustment
Good idea and solid test coverage, but redundant after the shipped fix.

## Implementation Plan
No new implementation needed; the shipped fix uses `path.sep` with additional Windows tests.

## Draft Response (requires approval)
Thanks for the thorough PR and test suite! We shipped a fix for Windows path validation in v1.3.1, so I’m closing this as resolved. Your analysis helped validate the root cause and edge cases—appreciate it.
