## Intent
Fix Windows install failures by replacing hardcoded `/` with `path.relative()`-based validation, and fix CLI version output by reading from `package.json`.

## Relationship Quality
Strong — addresses the Windows path error and the version mismatch reported in #20/#42, plus duplicates #17/#28/#29/#34.

## Agent Score Adjustment
Solid approach with two fixes, but PR #38 is cleaner for the path check and includes clearer tests. Keep this as a reference for the version fix.

## Implementation Plan
1. Apply the Windows path fix using `path.sep` (per PR #38) in `src/commands/install.ts`.
2. Update tests to exercise cross-platform separators.
3. Pull in the dynamic version read from this PR (`src/cli.ts`).

## Draft Response (requires approval)
Thanks for the PR! I’m implementing the fixes directly: using a cross-platform path check to fix Windows installs, and reading the CLI version from `package.json`. I’ll credit this PR in the release notes when the patch ships.
