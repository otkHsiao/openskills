## Intent
Improve UX during git clone by using async spawn (so the spinner animates) and swap `ora` for `nanospinner`. Also claims to fix a JSON import warning.

## Relationship Quality
No linked issues; relationship quality remains none.

## Agent Score Adjustment
Low confidence because it introduces a dependency change and touches core install flow without a strong demand signal.

## Implementation Plan
1. Decide if spinner UX is a priority.
2. If yes, switch clone to `spawn` while keeping `ora` (avoid dependency swap unless needed).
3. Verify no regression in error handling for git clone failures.
4. Update tests if necessary (none currently).

## Draft Response (requires approval)
Thanks for the PR! I need to decide whether we want to change the spinner/dependency and async clone behavior. I’ll circle back after reviewing UX priorities and risk.
