## Intent
Add Nix flake support for reproducible builds and dev shells (`nix build`, `nix run`, `nix develop`).

## Relationship Quality
No linked issues; relationship quality remains none.

## Agent Score Adjustment
Moderate value for Nix users; low urgency and adds maintenance overhead for lockfile updates.

## Implementation Plan
1. Decide if we want to support Nix officially.
2. If yes, add `flake.nix`/`flake.lock` and a brief README note.
3. Add `.gitignore` entries for `result` and `.direnv`.

## Draft Response (requires approval)
Thanks for the PR! I like the Nix support, but I need to decide if we want to maintain flake files in core. I’ll follow up after that call.
