## Intent
Prevent accidental permanent deletions by moving skills to the system trash/recycle bin by default. Adds a `--force` flag for permanent deletes and introduces a `trash` helper.

## Relationship Quality
No linked issue; behavior change proposal. Relationship quality remains none.

## Agent Score Adjustment
Low confidence due to dependency risk and behavior change (Linux support caveats). Needs maintainer decision before implementation.

## Implementation Plan
1. Decide whether default deletion should be “trash” or remain permanent.
2. If accepted, add `trash` dependency and a small wrapper (or optional dependency) with graceful fallback on Linux.
3. Add `--force` (or `--permanent`) flag to `remove` and `manage`.
4. Add tests around deletion mode selection (avoid actual trash in tests).
5. Update README + changelog for behavior change.

## Draft Response (requires approval)
Thanks for the PR! I like the safety angle, but this changes deletion semantics and adds a dependency with Linux caveats. I need to decide if we want this behavior in core. I’ll follow up once I make that call.
